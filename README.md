What Is IP Spoofing
Data is transferred via the internet through "packets." An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique code that each computer has that identifies the machine these packets are being sent from. IP addresses can be used to identify where a computer is connecting from. In many cases IP look-up services such as whois.com can provide information about who may be using the computer that is associated with an IP address. IP Spoofing is the process of using a fake or random IP address in an attempt to mask where a computer is connecting from or which computer is connecting to a network.

Why IP Spoofing Happens
As the internet has grown in scope and usability, so too has the network of individuals who would seek to manipulate internet network protocols for criminal and malicious purposes. Not all cases of IP spoofing are of malevolent intent; for example, some people choose to spoof their IP addresses when going to web sites that the believe have politically or morally questionable content, in fear that their IP address will be saved and they may one day be associated with unpopular causes or viewpoints. However, a significant percentage of IP spoofing happens because those with dubious intent seek to disguise the source of their attacks.

For example, individuals or groups coordinating denial of service (DOS) attacks will often send a barrage of traffic in the form of fake or random IP addresses to certain websites or networks in an attempt to render the sever or servers hosting the sites incapable of processing the traffic, and thus anonymously shutting down the website or network.

Another common use of IP spoofing is the circumvention of user authentication based on IP address or region. For instance, many corporations use an intranet. In order to access all the content on this intranet, the machines requesting access must have an IP address within a specified valid range that shows it is recognized as a trusted machine or the machine is being access from a trusted location. By spoofing a connection from a trusted machine, individuals are able to bypass this authentication method and illegally access the network.

Ways To Protect Yourself Against IP Spoofing
IP spoofing can allow an outside party to steal sensitive information or inflict damage on your network. Fortunately, there are a few ways that you can protect yourself against this menace.

The first step you should take is to eliminate host-based authentication on your network. Host-based authentication uses the public host key of the client machine to authenticate a user. Rely instead on network encryption, which sends encrypted packets over a network.

Ingress filtering, a technique which verifies that packets are coming from a legitimate source, is also an invaluable tool to safeguard against attacks perpetuated through IP spoofing.

Egress filtering, in which packets that are being sent out of the internal network are examined via a router or firewall and questionable packets are detained, is often used in conjunction with ingress filtering.
